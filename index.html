<b>how the web works</b><br>

<dl>
  <dt>user+access</dt>
  <dd>browser, which reads and display the content and the elements of HTML (like the right screen of scratchpad.io)</dd>
  <dt>HTTP</dt>
  <dd>this sends a request to the server to get a particular HTML document (e.g. <a href="www.economist.com">www.economist.com</a>) and all the links are, again, instructions to retrieve some HTML document from some servers</dd>
  <dt>internet</dt>
  <dd>mainly HTML (but can be anything really, word documents, images etc.)</dd>
  <dt>servers</dt>
  <dd>where files are stored</dd>

<b>HTML (hypertext markup language)</b><br>
the main type of content/documents on the web<br>

<p><b>HTML elements</b><p>basically, telling the computer what to do. 
seemed too much effort - i might as well draw/write on paper - 
but i wouldn't want to write and draw <em>1 million copies </em>
(so there are somethings that are better done by computers and some by humans still) <p>and elements have tags indicating where they start and end, like brackets but with the bracket signs replaces by "more than " or "less than" symbols."</p></p></p>

<p><b>inline vs block elements</b><p>HTML elements can be either <em>inline</em> or <em>block.</em> </p></p>
Block elements put an "invisible box" (otherwise everything is treated as a single white space by HTML) around the content within the block tag.
